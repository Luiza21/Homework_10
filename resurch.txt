Tilde ~ is almost linear in appearance and wants to go backward in a straight line
Caret ^ suggests an interesting segment of a tree or a fork in the road

A suffix ~<n> to a revision parameter means the commit object that is the nth generation ancestor of the named commit object, following only the first parents.
You can get to parents of any commit, not just HEAD. You can also move back through generations: for example, master~2 means the grandparent of the tip of the master branch, favoring the first parent on merge commits.

A suffix ^ to a revision parameter means the first parent of that commit object. ^<n> means the nth parent 
Git history is nonlinear: a directed acyclic graph (DAG) or tree. For a commit with only one parent, rev~ and rev^ mean the same thing. The caret selector becomes useful with merge commits because each one is the child of two or more parents â€” and strains language borrowed from biology.
